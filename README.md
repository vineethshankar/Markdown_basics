I am learning Git markdown.


[Here is the cheat sheet for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

//This is verbatim. Code blocks can be entered with backticks

//```python

//print "hello world"

//```

```python
print "hello world"
```

> Blockquotes is a cool feature. Can be used to add descriptions or 
> repeat text from emails.
